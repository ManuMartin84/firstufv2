     <f1><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></f1>
     <p> The proposal of creating a web application in which there are different web pages challenges me to do practical work that I had never attempted before, managing to learn how web pages are composed and becoming small designers for the future.</p>
      <p>The website serves as a central component of digital marketing strategies, and also provides us with a platform for direct interaction with clients or visitors, facilitating communication and allowing regular updates. So, rather than seeing it as a job to approve, we understand it as an opportunity to learn this language and be able to control the page.</p>
