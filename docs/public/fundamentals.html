            The subject delves into the immense relevance that information has acquired in contemporary society, being a crucial element in both daily life and in business and professional spheres. Since the advent of computers, the volume of handled data has experienced exponential growth, and in this scenario, the computer emerges as the indispensable tool capable of managing massive volumes of information in significantly reduced time periods.

The central <b>objective</b> of the subject is to provide students with comprehensive knowledge of the computer tool, from its most elementary structure to its vital role in the generation, transmission, and reception of information. In this regard, the following general objectives are proposed for students: to fully understand the essential components of a computer and how they interact with each other; to distinguish between different types of computers and the various applications run on each of them; to acquire knowledge about how other elements or systems communicate with computers, including sensors and actuators; and to develop skills in the use of basic computer applications relevant to an engineer.
           <br>
           <br>
As a prerequisite, it is expected that students have <b>basic knowledge</b> in computer use, which implies a general understanding of its operation and the ability to use computer applications fundamentally. The subject aims not only to expand but also to deepen this knowledge, providing a solid foundation for understanding the interconnection of systems, the diversity of applications, and communication with external devices in the context of computer engineering.
Additionally, the importance of this understanding in the current business and professional context is emphasized, where decision-making and problem-solving depend largely on the ability to manipulate and understand information efficiently. The continuous evolution of computer technology is also highlighted, stressing the need for engineers to be prepared to adapt to these changes, understanding how computers interconnect, create networks, and provide services to various applications. Ultimately, the subject is presented as a cornerstone for students, equipping them with the necessary tools to navigate successfully in the dynamic and complex field of computer engineering.
