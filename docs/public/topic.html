      <f1><u><b>How it works?</b></u></f1>
     <ul>
       <li>
         <p><u>Transfer Window Period</u>: The winter transfer window allows clubs to make changes to their squads halfway through the season. During this time, clubs can negotiate and complete transfers for players.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <p><u>Player Registration</u>: For a player to be eligible to play for a new club, the transfer must be completed before the deadline, and the player must be registered with the new club according to the rules of the relevant football association.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <p><u>Negotiations</u>: Clubs negotiate transfer fees, contract terms, and other details with each other and the player's representatives. .</p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p><u>Contract Signing</u>: Once all terms are agreed upon, and the medical examinations are passed, the player signs a new contract with the buying club. The transfer is then completed, and the player is officially a member of the new team.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p><u>Loan Deals</u>: In addition to permanent transfers, clubs can also negotiate loan deals during the January transfer window. In a loan deal, a player temporarily joins another club for a specified period, usually until the end of the season.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p><u>Player Eligibility</u>: It's important to note that players signed or loaned during the January transfer window are typically eligible to play for their new clubs immediately, provided the necessary paperwork is completed before the deadline.</p>
