    <div class=""> <u><b><p>About Me</p></b></u>           
      <p>
        Hello! My name is <b>Manuel Martín Arvilla</b>, and I am currently immersed in an exciting stage of my academic life at Francisco de Vitoria University (<a href="https://www.ufv.es/">UFV</a>) , where I embarked on a double degree in Computer Engineering and Business Analytics. My decision to combine these disciplines stems from my deep interest in the convergence of technology and data-driven decision-making, two fundamental pillars in today's business landscape.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        In the sports arena, my connection with soccer and paddle tennis goes beyond mere participation. In addition to being a passionate player, I have the privilege of serving as a soccer coach, an experience that extends beyond the field lines and has provided valuable lessons in leadership, teamwork, and handling challenging situations.
        
        Outside the academic and sports realms, I find my escape in nature through hunting. This hobby not only allows me to disconnect and recharge but also strengthens my connection with the natural environment and the importance of conserving our natural heritage.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        What excites me most about my career is the ability to control and analyze data to thoroughly understand how a company operates. The application of computer science concepts and business analysis techniques fascinates me, and I am convinced that this unique combination of skills prepares me to address business challenges comprehensively.
        
        Throughout my academic and sports journey, I have learned to balance my passions and commitments effectively. This ability to manage time and maintain a multifaceted focus is reflected in my performance both in the classroom and on the playing field.
        
        In summary, I am a passionate and committed university student with a inclination towards technology, sports, and nature. My holistic approach and varied experiences have provided me with a unique perspective that I am eager to apply in my future professional endeavors. I am excited about the opportunities that will arise and contributing meaningfully to the world around me!
