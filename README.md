The work has given us a mentality closer to that of a web page creator and has taught us the basics of html. The only main problem I find with this work is that it takes up a large amount of time, at a time close to the final exams.

# images
When it comes to attaching images I have found it easy, including them in my work folder from the desktop application.

# Public
This part of the html, where the content is located, is the most extensive part of the work. I consider it an entertaining exercise, and not at all arduous, that transforms our brains, learning the language of programming. The html (index, about, net, topic, degree... ) have been like our skeleton of the work, to which we have connected with a css to give it the skin and make it more attractive to the eyes.
However, trying to use a browser, which would move me from page to page without giving problems, was complicated, as all the pages have to be linked to each other in a specific way.

# css

The css, was the one that gave colour to our pages, linking it at the beginning of each one with a "style", being able to edit from the css both images and texts.
The big problem I found here is that many times I had problems that made my css not responding and I wasted a lot of time inspecting the page, looking for where and what was the problem.
